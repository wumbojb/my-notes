## ðŸ“Œ Callout Usage Guide  

Callouts are used to provide annotations or highlight important information in notes without disrupting the main text flow. This feature is inspired by [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and can be used for various purposes such as info, warnings, tips, and code examples.  

### âœ¨ How to Use Callouts  
To create a callout, add `[!type]` at the beginning of a quote block (`>`). The callout type determines its appearance and icon.  

#### ðŸ“– Basic Example  
```markdown  
> [!info] This is an example info callout  
> This callout provides additional information.  
```  
> [!info] This is an example info callout  
> This callout provides additional information.

### ðŸ“‚ Nested Callouts  
You can also nest multiple callouts inside each other to organize information more neatly.  
```markdown
> [!question] Can callouts be chained?  
> > [!todo] Yes! This is an example of a nested callout.  
> > > [!example] You can even have multiple layers of callouts!  
```  

> [!question] Can callouts be chained?

> > > [!example] You can even have multiple layers of callouts!
