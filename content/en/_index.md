# **[New Hugo Theme] My Notes – Minimalist & Multi-Language Theme for Blog and Documentation**

Hello everyone! 👋  

I've just started learning Hugo, and **My Notes** is my first theme. I'm still new to Hugo, so there's not much I know yet, but this theme is the result of my learning process. Since this is my first time creating and sharing a theme, I'm really looking forward to feedback from the community before officially submitting it to the Hugo theme directory.  

## 🔹 **Main Features**  
- 🌓 **Dark and Light Mode**  
- 🌍 **Multi-language support (16 languages pre-configured)**  
- 🏷️ **Taxonomy system (Tags, Categories, Series, etc.)**  
- 🔍 **Lightweight Lunr.js based search (JSON API based)**  
- ✍️ **Markdown-focused design with syntax highlighting**  
- 📐 **Fully responsive layout with 3 sidebar options**  
- 🔥 **SCSS based styling**  
- 🚀 **Optimized for performance and fast loading**  
- 📄 **Mermaid & GoAT diagram support + MathJax for equations**

## 🛠️ **Looking for Feedback!**  
Since this is my **first Hugo project** and also my **first theme**, I really appreciate any feedback or suggestions from the Hugo community. I'm still learning, so if anyone is interested in testing it or providing suggestions, it would be very helpful!  

- Did you find any bugs or issues?
- Are there any missing features that would be useful?
- Is the documentation clear and easy to follow?

All feedback is welcome! Thank you so much for your time. 😊🚀
